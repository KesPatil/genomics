## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/KesPatil/genomics/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.


Years of silence cause the inner flooding of the desire to express and from the many other alternatives possible is channeled here in words framed as poems, time-tested technique to creep in hidden messages often captured in one or few sentences amongst the whole.


THIS IS MY FIRST POEM---
No,
Time's neither on the end ,nor is it late to take a vow,
to cherish all the aspects of life that you owe,
to your parents and ancestral 
generations near and far above.
Yes,
its not wise to credit ,yourself alone with the success,
celebrations,moments of exuberance and praises,
coz all those dark-faint,burning-shivering,
breathless heights-drowning deeps of life phases,
were accompanied by blood relations or their soul gazes.
Hey,
why you cry upon your stars & lead yourself astray,
jeevan me tu kya kuch nahi kar sakta bey?
Your childhood may not have allowed you 
to have a royal elephant ride,
dear,grow on your feet ,fly in the 
planes in the skies far and wide.
Let the same sky witness your glorious 
passion;
But do not let you feet off the ground,
which supported your ambition,
coz life is not a curse,its an examination..
